## Abstract

### Project Goals

## Development Plan

### Constrains/Limitations

## Experimental Results

### Bug List
- App seems to time out during RecordPathActivity if it runs too long
- After RecordPathActivity crashes, upon openeing it again hitting "Start Path" btn will crash (propbably because it shouldn't be enabled yet)
- "Confirm Landmark" button on replay path screen does nothing
- Waypoint list is static
- "Stop Path" currently only capable of fully stoping path, would be useful to be able to pause
- using a duplicate path name for a new path fully crashes the app, should be an error message
- path name gets saved even if user never records path
